# Project 3: Around The U.S.

## Overview

- Objective
- Techniques
- Images

**Objective**

This project aims to build a responsive webpage to showcase overall knowledge and techniques covered through Sprint 3, including grid layout, relative units of measurement, and media queries.

**Techniques**

- Implementing Grid Layout for building interactive webpage that is responsive with respect to different screen resolutions
- Establishing Semantic HTML structure according to the Figma design spec sheet
- Media queries to set and define style rules for elements in response to change in condition(s)

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!
